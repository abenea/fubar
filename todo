Clean things up:
reduce console output of lastfm
deal somehow with  accessed_by_taglib(at least rename)
make lastfm plugin code less lame. 

Possible bugs:
not using persistent indexes in PlaylistTab can result in weird behavior when playing while adding tracks to playlist
enqueue_next

Features:
[lastfm] config dialog
Save playlists.
Save current playlist + current position.
Cue sheets.
Multiple cds.


Known issues:
Seekbar gets stuck at start. (probably backend issue)
[lastfm] not handling user seeks. too lazy.
Volume slider repaints correctly at the first play.

Statusbar track progress is wrong when song ends. (probably backend issue)
Immediately when a new track is enqueued (at aboutToFinish()) the totalTime() is set to the one of the enqueued track, thus screwing seekbar and progress message.
