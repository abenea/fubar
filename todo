Bugs:
Scan doesn't read tags always?
[lastfm] trackPlaying is reported although nothing plays. Reproduce: play song, set filter so there's no results. stop. play. (after some clicking pause/stop/play it starts playing)

Clean things up:
deal somehow with  accessed_by_taglib(at least rename)
make plugin code less lame. 

Features:
[lastfm] config dialog
Save playlists.
Save current playlist + current position.
Enter in filter plays first track (and clears filter?)
Cue sheets.
Multiple cds.

Known issues:
[lastfm] not handling user seeks. too lazy.
Volume slider repaints correctly at the first play.
Seekbar gets stuck at start (Reproduce by playing last part of T-ara - I go crazy because of you.).
